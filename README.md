# Setup
1. Install node.js ^8.0.0 (I like to install it with [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation))
2. Run `npm install`

Run `bash getsite.sh <domain_name>` to generate a static site. A folder with the same name as the website will be generated containing the static content.

Example: `bash getsite.sh www.example.com`
